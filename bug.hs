```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code has a potential issue related to laziness.  If the list `xs` was significantly larger or generated lazily (e.g., from an infinite list), the `sort` function might consume excessive memory or take an unexpectedly long time to compute.  Haskell's lazy evaluation means that `sort` won't start processing until the result is needed. This isn't always a problem, but it can lead to performance issues or even stack overflows in specific cases.
